## Prerequisites:

1. [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/)
2. Enable .htaccess in your Apache's `conf/httpd.conf` to allow SSI to join the other `htdocs/SSI-HTML` webpages together

<hr>

The "htdocs" folder contains all of the files on the
main-part of the AssaultCube website, except the following:

	./schemas		(link)
	./transformations	(link)
	./$_DATA_STORAGE	(folder/contents)

The "dollar underscore" folders and its contents aren't kept in
this repository, as their contents may change at any time without
warning and aren't essential to the running of the website.

This folder does/will not contain (at least, for now):
 * The forum
 * The wiki
 * The masterserver

Any AssaultCube documentation should be added to ./htdocs/docs
from now on. Upon any AC releases, simply copy/paste
the ./htdocs/docs folder into the release. No changes necessary.

<hr>

## Other folders/files in THIS directory:

 * "README.md" - Information about the "ac_website" repository (this file).
 * "DATASTORAGE_HEADER.html" - This file will update the parts of the webpage
   found at https://assault.cubers.net/$_DATA_STORAGE that aren't automatically
   generated by APACHE. On the actual site, this file is normally named "HEADER.html".
 * "DOCS_TEMPLATE.html" - This file should be used as a template for any new
    documentation webpage. Read this file for more info.
<hr>

## LIST OF FILES TO CHANGE UPON NEW RELEASES:

 * Update ./htdocs/SSI-HTML/download_box.html
 * Update ./htdocs/download.html
 * Update "docswarning" with the location of the new versions
   current docfiles at ./htdocs/SSI-HTML/docs/docswarn.html
 * Check/Update ./htdocs/index.html if any AC specifications have changed.
 * Update ./htdocs/docs/history.html
 * Add new ./htdocs/uninstallnotes webpage.
 * Add new ./htdocs/releasenotes webpage.
